    "(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\n",
    "is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\n",

    "protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\n",
    "the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\n",
    "client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\n",
    "first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\n",
    "between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\n",
    "called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\n",
    "returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\n",
    "that there was no overlap in the lists).\n",
    "This function is typically called from a server side application callback for\n",
    "ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\n",
    "of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\n",
    "length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\n",
    "normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\n",
    "SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\n",
    "supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\n",
    "application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\n",
    "accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\n",
    "accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\n",
    "parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\n",
    "response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\n",
    "will be vulnerable to this problem.\n",
    "In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\n",
    "a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\n",
    "in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\n",
    "from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\n",
    "However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\n",
    "client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\n",
    "application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\n",
    "confidentiality will occur.\n",
    "This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\n",
    "likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\n",
    "widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\n",

       "### Open Source Software Related to the Incident Scenario and Vulnerabilities\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the scenario focuses on a targeted cyberattack, some open-source software that could be involved, based on the techniques used, include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Apache HTTP Server**: A commonly used public-facing application that might have vulnerabilities exploitable for initial access (e.g., CVE-2021-41773, a path traversal vulnerability).\n",
       "2. **WordPress**: A popular CMS often integrated with Apache or other web servers, which could contain vulnerabilities for exploitation (e.g., CVE-2022-2444, a cross-site scripting vulnerability).\n",
       "3. **OpenSSL**: As indicated by your query about CVE-2024-5535, vulnerabilities in OpenSSL could affect secure communication and potentially be leveraged if the application relies on it.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Assessment of CVE-2024-5535 in the Incident\n",
       "\n",
       "**Affected Status:** Based on the provided scenario, the direct exploitation of CVE-2024-5535 does not seem to align with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the FIN13 threat actor group. The vulnerability involves a buffer overread in the SSL/TLS protocol handling within OpenSSL, primarily affecting applications that incorrectly use the SSL_select_next_proto function. Since FIN13's TTPs focus on exploiting public-facing applications, maintaining persistence through web shells, and stealing financial data, a vulnerability in SSL/TLS negotiation is less relevant to their primary objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "**CVSS Score Analysis:**\n",
       "The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3 provides a standardized method for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities. For CVE-2024-5535:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Base Metrics:**\n",
       "  - **Confidentiality Impact (C):** High (`C:H`) – Up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data could be leaked.\n",
       "  - **Integrity Impact (I):** None (`I:N`) – No direct impact on data integrity.\n",
       "  - **Availability Impact (A):** None (`A:N`) – Does not cause a denial of service.\n",
       "  - **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (`AV:N`) – Attack can be performed over the network.\n",
       "  - **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (`AC:L`) – The attack doesn't require a specific condition to be met.\n",
       "  - **Privileges Required (PR):** None (`PR:N`) – No privileges required for the attack.\n",
       "  - **User Interaction (UI):** None (`UI:N`) – Attack doesn't rely on user interaction.\n",
       "  - **Scope (S):** Unchanged (`S:U`) – The scope of the vulnerability is limited to the impacted component.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given these metrics, the Base Score calculation would be:\n",
       "`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`\n",
       "\n",
       "However, considering the note that exploitation is unlikely due to application configurations and that NPN is deprecated in favor of ALPN, which is not vulnerable, the environmental and temporal metrics could adjust the overall score.\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the provided impact summary and the fact that exploitation depends on several uncommon conditions, the CVSS score might not reach the highest levels. But without the exact CVSS v3 scores, an estimated severity rating based on the description leans towards **Medium** due to the potential for confidentiality loss. \n",
       "\n",
       "**Generated Score (Estimate):** 5 out of 10\n",
       "\n",
       "This estimation assumes a medium severity based on the potential for information disclosure but takes into account the mitigating factors like the low likelihood of occurrence due to specific application misconfigurations needed for exploitation. The actual CVSS score should be calculated with the complete formula and validated against official sources."
