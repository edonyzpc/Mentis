# Incident TTP Scenario
## Overview
This incident response testing scenario evaluates the company’s readiness and response capabilities against a cyber attack orchestrated by the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group APT16. The scenario focuses on the resource development phase of the kill chain, specifically the use of servers for malicious activities (T1584.004).

## Company Profile
- **Industry**: Technology / IT
- **Size**: Large Enterprise (10,000+ employees)

## Threat Actor Information
- **Threat Actor Group**: APT16
- **Kill Chain Phase**: Resource Development
- **Technique**: Server (T1584.004)

## Incident TTP Testing Scenario
### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Objective**:
   - To prepare the environment for testing the company’s incident response capabilities against a server-based attack by APT16.
2. **Key Activities**:
    - **Risk Assessment**:
      - Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify critical servers that could be targeted.
    - **Baseline Establishment**:
      - Establish a baseline of normal server activity to detect anomalies.
    - **Detection Tools Configuration**:
      - Ensure all detection tools (SIEM, EDR, etc.) are properly configured and monitored.
    - **Training**:
      - Provide training to all participants on the specific tactics and techniques used by APT16.

### Phase 2: Detection & Analysis
1. **Trigger Event**:
    - **Simulated Initial Compromise**:
      - Stage a phishing email campaign targeting key IT personnel.
      - Include a link or attachment that, when clicked, triggers a simulated malware payload designed to establish a foothold on the target system.
    - **Server Compromise**:
      - Use the compromised system to gain access to a critical server (T1584.004).
      - Simulate the creation of a backdoor or other persistent access mechanism on the server.
2. **Key Indicators**:
    - **Unusual Network Traffic**:
      - Outbound connections from the compromised server.
    - **Anomalies in Log Files**:
      - Unauthorised access attempts, changes in system configurations.
3. **Activities**:
    - **Monitoring**:
      - Continuously monitor the network for signs of unusual activity.
    - **Alert Generation**:
      - Trigger alerts through the SIEM system when suspicious activities are detected.
    - **Analysis**:
      - Evaluate the timeliness and accuracy of the alerts generated.
      - Analyse the network traffic and log files to identify the source and nature of the compromise.

### Phase 3: Containment
1. **Objective**:
   - To contain the compromise and prevent further spread within the network.
2. **Steps**:
    - **Isolation**:
      - Disconnect the compromised server from the network.
    - **Access Control**:
      - Restrict access to the compromised server to authorised personnel only.
3. **Activities**:
    - **Documentation**:
      - Document all actions taken during containment.
    - **Communication**:
      - Inform relevant stakeholders about the containment measures.

### Phase 4: Eradication
1. **Objective**:
   - To remove the malicious presence from the compromised server and related systems.
2. **Steps**:
    - **Malware Removal**:
      - Utilise anti-malware tools to remove the simulated malware.
    - **Patch Application**:
      - Apply security patches to fix vulnerabilities exploited by APT16.
3. **Activities**:
    - **System Reconfiguration**:
      - Reconfigure the compromised server to restore it to its pre-compromise state.
    - **Validation**:
      - Validate that the server is free of malware and can be safely reconnected to the network.

### Phase 5: Recovery
1. **Objective**:
   - To restore affected systems to their operational state while ensuring they are secure.
2. **Steps**:
    - **Data Restoration**:
      - Restore data from backups if necessary.
    - **System Hardening**:
      - Implement additional security controls to prevent future compromises.
3. **Activities**:
    - **Testing**:
      - Test restored systems to ensure they function correctly.
    - **Post-Recovery Validation**:
      - Validate that the systems are secure and operational.

### Phase 6: Lessons Learned
1. **Objective**:
   - To analyse the results of the incident response testing and identify areas for improvement.
2. **Steps**:
    - **Review Meeting**:
      - Conduct a post-incident review meeting with all participants.
    - **Report Compilation**:
      - Compile a detailed report outlining the findings.
3. **Activities**:
    - **Feedback Collection**:
      - Collect feedback from participants regarding the effectiveness of the response.
    - **Process Improvement**:
      - Update incident response plans and procedures based on the findings.

## Conclusion
This testing scenario provides a structured approach to evaluating the company’s incident response capabilities against a targeted server-based attack by APT16. It enables the identification of strengths and weaknesses in current processes and technologies, facilitating continuous improvement in cybersecurity posture.
